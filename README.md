OnePageStore
============

* Uses PHP class called AmazonApi to set proper parameters and create signed URL's for use with Amazon's Product Advertising API
* Also makes use of a very basic cURL class to retrieve response XML file
* Then, on one page, user can view products, add them to a remote cart (or remove something they've already added), and finally click the Purchase URL link to checkout at Amazon proper.
